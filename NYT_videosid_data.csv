5mqc5fJvjLo,The New York Times,Watch Mikey Madison Tour a Mansion in ‘Anora’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"When Ani (Mikey Madison) agrees to meet one of her young strip-club clients, Ivan (Mark Eydelshteyn), at his home, she is taken aback by just how lavish that home is. That’s the setup for this scene from “Anora,” which follows the budding relationship, both transactional and emotional, between the title character, Ani, and Ivan.

This sequence takes place before Ani learns that Ivan is the son of a Russian oligarch, and it is crafted to give both Ani and the audience an eye-opening look at the outsize abundance of Ivan’s space.

Narrating the scene, the film’s writer, director and editor, Sean Baker, said, “I wanted the camera to essentially be following Ani, but also be seeing the world through Ani’s eyes.” He achieved this by keeping the cuts to a minimum. After Ani rings the doorbell and Ivan answers, the bulk of the sequence unfolds in one shot, following her with a hand-held camera (operated by the cinematographer Drew Daniels) as she marvels over the mansion.

“It really sets up the geography,” Baker said, “because the geography is going to be extremely important later on in the film.”

HyzGkEV3p2g,The New York Times,"If You Think Biden and Harris Were Weak on the Border, Think Again | NYT Opinion","Immigration is a top issue on voters’ minds. When people talk about President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’s handling of immigration, they usually say something like: Record numbers of migrants poured across the border over the past three years, and Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris ignored the crisis until recently. They were weak on the border. Or worse, inept.

I wanted to know how the president and vice president could mess this up so badly. What in the world were they doing?

The Opinion video above tells the little-known story of how Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris worked behind the scenes to get the border crisis under control. I found that they acted strategically, out of the spotlight, since the earliest days of the administration. They even bucked their own party and fulfilled Republican wishes, though they’ve gotten little credit for it.

Their hard work finally paid off when illegal crossings dropped significantly this year.

In politics, there’s the story that gets told in public, and then there’s what really happened behind closed doors. In this case, those two narratives are worlds apart. And Ms. Harris is paying for it. When polled, a majority of voters said they believed Donald Trump would handle immigration better than Ms. Harris.

If voters knew how Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris actually handled the border crisis, they’d most likely have a different opinion of which candidate could be trusted on this cornerstone issue.

rMMf7ZdbpDs,The New York Times,"For Day of the Dead, I Followed This Flower's Journey | Op-Docs","The life of the marigold, known as the cempasúchil in Mexico, reflects our own: the plant sprouts, grows, flowers and dies. The flowers’ yellow and orange glow is ubiquitous across Mexico every year in the first few days of November, during Day of the Dead, as families place cempasúchil flowers on altars and at cemeteries to create a path to guide their loved ones back home.

My grandmother died of Covid in October 2020, just as the cempasúchil began to appear in the markets of Mexico City. Her death was sudden, and it was a painful experience for my family. Because of the restrictions on gatherings during Covid in Mexico, a funeral was not held after her death.

A few days later, my cousin Gabriel, who lived with my grandmother, went to buy the materials for her first altar. When I saw the image of the altar through family text messages, I was struck by the beauty of his gift to her memory. He created it alone in their shared apartment; this was the only ceremony he could assemble to celebrate her life.

Around her portrait beamed the sunlike glow of the cempasúchil. Absorbed by its radiance, I wondered what other hands had passed over the flowers resting on her altar. Had they faced a similar loss? Did they have the chance to celebrate their loved ones?

These questions led me to retrace the path that those flowers traveled: from the fields where they were harvested to the markets where they were sold and then to my grandmother’s altar. Along the way, I met people who had lost their loved ones to Covid and gained a deeper understanding of the unique grief we experienced during the pandemic. In the short documentary above, “más y más y más flores,” I observe how the cempasúchil not only connects us to those in the realm beyond, but to one another in the world of the living.

After the Day of the Dead has passed, when the flowers wither and fall, seeds appear and scatter. From its own death, the cempasúchil’s next cycle of life begins.

7Re-LyLhOwI,The New York Times,Watch Ralph Fiennes Deliver a Startling Speech in ‘Conclave’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"The selection of a new pope is at the center of “Conclave,” the latest drama from the director Edward Berger (“All Quiet on the Western Front”). But while the setting is reverent, the movie finds its narrative propulsion in what its characters try to hide or, in this scene, what they surprisingly decide to express.

Ralph Fiennes plays Cardinal Lawrence, the dean of the College of Cardinals, the group that will elect a new pope. The character has operated on the sidelines for much of his time in the church, but something bolder happens here. He addresses the cardinals in a homily that starts formally and ends with personal expressions of doubt.

Narrating the scene, Berger said that it sets up Lawrence “as a character to be reckoned with. He delivers this speech that comes from his heart, and other cardinals, especially the ones with ambition to become the next pope, suddenly fear that there’s a new contender in the room.”

The Right Is Being Lied To. | NYT Opinion,"The United States is closer than ever to achieving the dream it’s been chasing since 1776: an inclusive democracy that lives up to the promise of one person, one vote. But since 2020, election deniers have sought to undermine America’s collective voice with lies about the security of our elections. In the Opinion Video above, Neil Makhija — who will help oversee elections in his county in the battleground state of Pennsylvania — argues that our votes have never been safer or more secure. In fact, someone is more likely to be struck by lightning than to impersonate someone else at a polling site.

But we can’t afford to be complacent. “To protect democracy, we can’t just play defense,” Makhija cautions. “We need to go on offense to expand voting rights and voting access.”

KIYYBNgt_A4,The New York Times,Watch Dancers Haunt Naomi Scott in ‘Smile 2’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"A pop star finds herself surrounded by a menacing version of her dancers in this scene from “Smile 2.”

Naomi Scott plays Skye Riley, a pop star who has struggled with the personal demons of addiction. But as soon as she gets her life back on track, she becomes possessed by a different kind of demon, one that has her seeing hallucinations and spiraling once again out of control.

In this scene, Skye is in her apartment at night when she begins to see several dancers staring at her, wearing the sinister grin of the film’s title.

Narrating the scene, the film’s director, Parker Finn, said, “These dancers that I got to work with, and my choreographer, Celia Rowlson-Hall, it was this incredible collaboration to create something that felt both like a menacing attack, but also at the same time, dance.”

gwwuV0X7rdE,The New York Times,Come to Jail With Us. You’ll Need a Calculator. | NYT Opinion,"In the video above, we introduce viewers to Mike. He’s not a real person. He’s an invention, a generic character of our creation, whose grueling trip through the American criminal justice system is based on facts and real-world experiences.

Mike is our guide to a hidden form of punishment: criminal justice fees. These are levied against people at every turn in their path through the system. They can be big — like the cost of posting bail — or small, like fees to see a doctor in prison. They accumulate quickly and can turn into crushing debt.

This hypothetical narrative allowed us to show the myriad ways that fees are extracted from people in the justice system.

Why should we care if a person who commits a crime has to pay for some services? In short, because the fees can be incredibly destructive.

We’re not talking about fines, those monetary punishments that judges impose on offenders. And this isn’t about restitution, which is an additional sanction intended to reimburse victims. Fees are far more insidious, functioning like predatory taxes that raise revenue for the government. They can vary from state to state, municipality to municipality, institution to institution.

And they can have severe economic consequences, particularly for people who are already broke when they enter the system — that is, most people who run afoul of the law. The resulting debts can destroy people’s credit, prevent them from voting and interfere with their ability to find employment and housing.

Regional surveys in Alabama and New Mexico have suggested that at least 38 percent of people with court debt resort to crime to help pay it off. Criminal justice reform advocates have argued that a system that extracts wealth from some of the nation’s poorest people is counterproductive and can further destabilize society.

“Court debt impacts more people and for a longer period of time than almost any other issue in the criminal justice system,” said Joanna Weiss, an executive director of the Fines and Fees Justice Center in New York. “It’s a lifelong punishment, and the consequences are felt by the entire family.”

There has been some progress in reforming these practices in recent years, with various state and local governments lowering or removing criminal justice fees.

But the problem is still widespread. The Justice Department sent a letter to local and state judges around the country last year cautioning them against imposing high fees and fines on people unable to pay them. Such costs, it said, “cause profound harm.”

Which brings us back to Mike.

We constructed his story by examining the way fees are imposed across the country. In reality, there are hundreds of thousands of people like Mike who have become entangled in our criminal justice system, and many certainly have it even worse than he does.

To help show his experience, we were invited by a reform-minded sheriff, Chris Swanson of Genesee County, Mich., to film inside his jail in Flint. We spent two days there and were allowed to interview inmates, some of whom appear in the video above. (We also staged a mock courtroom scene in a nearby courthouse.)

But we want to be clear that this video isn’t specifically about Genesee County or the State of Michigan. Criminal justice fees are a deeply entrenched national problem, and they should be eliminated.

But a New York Times investigation found that they have succeeded only at making more pandas for zoos. Individual pandas have been hurt in the process, and at least one has been killed. Mara Hvistendahl, an investigative reporter for The New York Times focused on Asia, explains how records, photographs and videos — many of them from the Smithsonian Institution Archives — offer the most detailed, unvarnished history of the program.

In an hourlong interview with Lulu Garcia-Navarro, a host of “The Interview,” a Times podcast published each Saturday, Vance said he “focused on the future” when asked about the previous election. It was the same phrase he used to evade the question during his debate with Tim Walz.

eZOx3hEF1cE,The New York Times,Watch a Chaotic Rehearsal in ‘Saturday Night’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"Creating chaos onscreen requires a lot more planning than it might seem. That’s the case in this sequence from “Saturday Night,” the latest film from Jason Reitman, which looks at how the first episode of the long-running NBC sketch comedy show “Saturday Night Live” came together.

In the scene, the “S.N.L.” cast members John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd and Garrett Morris are rehearsing a sketch.

“At the beginning, you know, it’s going through the normal steps and trying to figure out camerawork,” Reitman says of the scene in his narration, and by the end, “it’s a total catastrophe.”

So how did Reitman go about building this out-of-control situation? For one, he put his background actors through a boot camp, where they learned how to do the jobs of the crew people they were portraying. And beyond that, he created detailed plans for the production team to follow.

“We had to choreograph this movie like a dance film,” Reitman said. “I’d have a giant whiteboard like a football coach. And I would have to write plays for all the extras and background actors and crew, just so everyone would know where to be.”

One thing they all have in common: high prices ($185 for a bulletproof pencil case, $450 for a hoodie, $60,000 for a shelter), prompting concerns that safety disparities could be exacerbated for low-income families and school districts. Some people see the items as unsettling but prudent; others find them infuriating.

BhE4A_B7R8g,The New York Times,How Tennessee Keeps Nearly Half a Million People From Voting | NYT Opinion,"The Opinion video above takes viewers to Tennessee, the Volunteer State, the capital of country music and the birthplace of Davy Crockett and the MoonPie — and a national leader in voter disenfranchisement.

The state has come about that last claim to fame through its handling of voting access for people convicted of felonies.

While nearly all states suspend or withdraw people’s right to vote when they are convicted of felonies, most allow restoring that right after they have served their sentences.

Many states have made that process easier in recent years — one of them being New York, to the advantage of felon-of-the-moment Donald Trump, who retains his right to vote as long as he’s not incarcerated.

But Tennessee has moved in the opposite direction, making the process significantly more difficult. (Think: bureaucratic maze from hell.)

About 9 percent of the state’s voting-age population is prohibited from voting because of felony convictions. And the effects are particularly acute among the Black population, with an astonishing 21 percent of Black adults barred from voting — the highest rate in the country.

Among them is Sarah Bynum, a community advocate convicted of a felony 30 years ago who has struggled to restore her voting rights and is featured in the video above. “Makes me feel like I’m a foreigner in my own country,” she laments.

AimB7P-6ZRA,The New York Times,How Optimus Prime Learned to Transform in ‘Transformers One’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"Transforming can be tough, especially if you’ve never done it before and you’re being shot at while tumbling down a hill.

That’s where the characters find themselves in “Transformers One,” the animated origin story of Optimus Prime and Megatron. Up to this point in the movie, the film’s leads have not been in the possession of the cogs needed to transform. Having just acquired them, the characters must quickly figure out how to use their new powers while under attack. It initially doesn’t go well.

“I had all the toys growing up,” the director Josh Cooley said in an interview. “Most of the time, they were just sitting around on the ground half-transformed because they were actually pretty hard to do."" Cooley said he thought it would be enjoyable to watch the characters struggle the same way he struggled with his toys.

Regarding that tumble, Cooley said that he wanted to use the hill to make transforming even more difficult. He said that one of his references was a cheese rolling competition that takes place each year in England.

The pattern suggests that in some cases, Catholic organizations saw Pacific nations as a “dumping ground” for abusive clergy. Pete McKenzie, a freelance journalist who covers the Pacific, explains.

Mr. Lichtman was among the few to accurately predict Mr. Trump’s victory in 2016 (earning him a Sharpie-scribbled note from the candidate lauding the “GOOD CALL!”). Immediately after the first 2024 presidential debate, between Mr. Trump and President Biden, Mr. Lichtman was also quick to warn that Mr. Biden dropping out of the race could be a “tragic mistake for Democrats,” leading him directly into an online battle with the forecaster Nate Silver. The confidence is rooted in Mr. Lichtman’s simple, history-driven model, which tunes out polls and pollsters and instead focuses on 13 true-or-false questions that he says hold the “keys” to the White House.

So can a model that looks all the way back to the horse and buggy days survive in an unprecedented election year marked by criminal proceedings, an assassination attempt and that Democratic switcheroo? Mr. Lichtman is confident that it can.

And what is his prediction in this unpredictable year? Well, for that, you’ll have to watch the video.

Democrats have seen their support slip in rural areas, ceding ground to Republicans. As such, rural voters in North Carolina could determine which way the state goes on Election Day, as Democrats hope to curb their losses in these communities and Republicans seek to solidify their grip. Here's what voters in Wilson County, about 50 miles east of Raleigh, said about the election.

ocwRXjhyU1M,The New York Times,‘I Don’t Want to Be in This Forever.’ Four Women Share Their Experiences in the Sex Trade | Op-Docs,"When the production team and I interviewed four women who worked in the sex trade in Wales for the film above, we were struck by the diversity of each interview: each revealing a different emotional state — whether it be loneliness, contempt or self-loathing.

Through a local organization, we connected with an outreach worker who supports vulnerable women. She was an essential link in making this film; her trust and love in the community made it possible for the women to open up to us.

To ensure the women felt comfortable sharing their often ignored stories without fear of judgment or compromised privacy, we chose to incorporate animation. Collaborating with illustrator and animator Ola Szmida was crucial. Her distinctive, stream-of-consciousness animation conveys the nuanced emotions and inner worlds of the women.

This film is about listening and understanding, seeing beyond the surface to the common threads that bind us all — resilience, loneliness, and the search for connection and purpose. We hope it fosters greater empathy and insight into lives that deserve to be understood and valued.

JsC5XWMEkII,The New York Times,Debunked Science Put This Man on Death Row. He’s Going to Be Executed Anyway. | NYT Opinion,"The Opinion Video above is the final episode in a series of three videos that take a stand against the death penalty in the United States. It features Charles Don Flores, who has been on death row in Texas since 1999, awaiting execution for a murder he insists he didn’t commit. That is where we met and filmed him.

The videos are in keeping with the editorial board’s longstanding position that the death penalty is full of bias and error, morally abhorrent, futile in deterring crime and should be abolished.

The series lands at a hopeful but still challenging time in the movement to get rid of capital punishment in the United States.

The death penalty has gradually been falling out of favor with officials and the broader public alike over the past three decades, in part owing to what the Death Penalty Information Center called “society’s greater understanding about the fallibility of our legal system and its inability to protect innocent people from execution.”

The number of states that have rejected capital punishment has increased steadily since the late 1990s. Twenty-nine states have now either abolished the death penalty or have paused executions by executive action, up from 12 states in 1999.

Last year, for the first time, a Gallup poll found that more Americans believe the death penalty is administered unfairly than fairly (50 percent versus 47 percent). And the percentage of people who support the death penalty has fallen steadily since the mid-1990s, according to Gallup, dropping to 53 percent this year, a five-decade low.

But other recent data urgently underscores how much hard work remains for abolitionists. The downward trend in the number of executions that prevailed for two decades — there were 11 in 2021, way down from the peak of 98 in 1999 — has recently reversed. There were 18 executions in 2022 and another 24 last year, a worrisome uptick driven in part by governors and prosecutors seeking to burnish their crime-fighting bona fides.

And there are still about 2,400 prisoners sitting on death row around the United States, awaiting execution.

Among them is Charles Don Flores, who was found guilty of killing a woman in Farmers Branch, Texas, in a drug-related home invasion.

His legal team plans to file a last-ditch request for a new trial, but it’s a long shot. Still, Flores’s request is plain: “Give me a fair shot.”

The case against him hinged on an investigative technique that is now prohibited in Texas. Yet because of it, Flores may soon die.

As many as 150,000 people might be dead, and millions are displaced, though the chaos has made an accurate count impossible. As the rebels eye the next city to “liberate,” in their words, they seem more equipped for battle than for defending their people against a famine hurtling towards them.

kVYXRtLoZNs,The New York Times,I Wanted to Torture My Mother’s Killer. Now I Want to Save His Life. | NYT Opinion,"Your mother is kidnapped from her home and brutally murdered, her body dumped in the woods off a quiet country road. The authorities find a suspect, tell you they’re going to seek the death penalty and ask you if you’re OK with that. How would you react? What would you do?

Brett Malone found himself in that very position when his mother, Mary Ann, was killed in 2000, and the Opinion video above is about the surprising path his life has taken since then.

The film is the second in a three-part series, with each taking a critical view of the death penalty by exposing flaws in cases and questioning whether retributive justice can truly provide closure. The videos are in keeping with The Times’s longstanding position that the punishment is full of bias and error, morally abhorrent and futile in deterring crime and should be abolished.

The series lands at a hopeful but still challenging time in the movement to get rid of capital punishment in the United States.

And there are still about 2,400 prisoners sitting on death row around the United States.

One of them is Jeremiah Manning, the man who killed Brett Malone’s mother. The two men have never met, but since her death, their lives — and their fates — have been deeply intertwined.

2And9HmTPw0,The New York Times,"He Didn’t Kill His Child, But He’s About to Be Executed Anyway | NYT Opinion","Admitting a mistake can be very hard. But how would it feel if the mistake helped put a man on death row?

That’s the burden the Rev. Brian Wharton has been carrying for more than two decades. He played a crucial role in the prosecution of Robert Roberson, who was found guilty in 2003 of killing his 2-year-old daughter and sentenced to death.

But as the Opinion video above explores, Wharton came to regret his involvement and the outcome of the case. He recently visited Texas death row, along with a crew from Opinion Video, and met with Roberson. It was the first time the men had spoken with each other since before Roberson’s conviction.

The film is the first in a three-part series that we’re publishing over the next few weeks, each taking a critical view of the death penalty by exposing flaws in cases and questioning whether retributive justice can truly provide closure. The videos are in keeping with The Times’s longstanding position that the punishment is full of bias and error, morally abhorrent and futile in deterring crime and should be abolished.

The series lands at a hopeful but still-challenging time in the movement to get rid of capital punishment in the United States.

And there are still about 2,400 prisoners sitting on death row around the United States, awaiting their execution. One of them is Robert Roberson. But in the video above, Wharton argues that the deeply flawed case against Roberson is a clear example of why the death penalty should be eliminated.

BFVfHhI1a5Y,The New York Times,Watch a Diner Chat in ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"You probably expect plenty of slicing and dicing in “Deadpool & Wolverine.,” also plenty of irreverence. But what you might not expect is a quiet, softer moment of reflection. This scene, narrated by the film’s director, Shawn Levy, offers exactly that.

Featuring Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, the sequence takes place in the Void, an environmental dumping ground of sorts where the refuse of various timelines is discarded, and where Deadpool and Wolverine find themselves. They come across an empty retro diner and go inside.

“It’s a pause along the journey,” Levy said in an extended interview, “and it’s the first meaty and substantial dialogue scene between the two characters, one of whom is famously motor-mouthed, the other of whom is famously laconic and internal.”

“This has always been one of Ryan’s and my favorite scenes from the moment we wrote it,” Levy continued, “because it puts two iconic antiheroes in this incredibly generic trope of the Americana road movie. So the mismatch of these visuals, two superheroes sitting in a booth in a ’50s diner while Patsy Cline plays on the jukebox — that was a thrill.”

02g989-bkik,The New York Times,How ‘Twisters’ Destroys a Motel | Anatomy of a Scene,"A grungy, empty pool becomes a motel’s greatest asset in this harrowing sequence from “Twisters.”

The storm chasers Kate (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and Tyler (Glen Powell) find themselves in a predicament when a tornado descends on a motel and the two must lead a group to safety. They head to the drained pool to stay out of the tornado’s path, along the way dodging debris that includes a soda machine and a trailer.

Much of the sequence gives the impression of a one-take shot, although it was stitched from different takes to best incorporate its visual effects. Those effects are a mix of the practical — one stunt performer was whisked 60 feet in the air — and the digital.

“I really wanted to film a night tornado,” Chung said, narrating the scene, “because growing up around Tornado Alley, the night tornadoes were always the most frightening.”

He said the intent of the scene and shooting it in this frantic, hand-held manner was to create “that subjective feeling of what it’s like to experience a tornado in real time.”

Chung said that while filming his cast inside the swimming pool, crew members were destroying the set outside, so as the scene ends and the characters emerge, they are seeing a damaged version of the set they hadn't seen going in.

QEfUKYIxNFg,The New York Times,These Michigan Voters Could Cost Biden the Election | NYT Opinion,"Does President Biden realize how angry some voters in Michigan are — specifically, Arab Americans?

That anger is on full display in Dearborn, a suburb of Detroit that has one of the highest percentages of Arab Americans among U.S. cities (54 percent, though experts believe that’s a significant undercount).

Opinion Video traveled to Dearborn to understand voter sentiment in a population that has the power to sway the election.

Michigan has over 200,000 registered voters who are Muslim — enough to swing the state. (Biden won Michigan by 154,000 votes in 2020.) Just finding a pro-Biden Arab American voter in Dearborn is not an easy task.

“I will not be voting for Biden, for sure. And no one will be voting for Biden that I know of,” said Wissam Charafeddine, a poet who works in the public school system. “It would be an insult to ask.”

The Opinion Video above surveys a group of voters who show that age is not Biden’s only problem.

dUyM-vaV0eE,The New York Times,I Went From Foster Care to Yale. This Is What I Learned About ‘Luxury Beliefs.’ | NYT Opinion,"In a 2017 Senate hearing, the Harvard sociologist Robert Putnam famously argued, “Rich kids and poor kids now grow up in separate Americas.” Rob Henderson knows this firsthand. His mother was addicted to drugs; he never knew his father. He grew up shuttling among foster homes, where he started drinking beer around age 5 and smoking marijuana at age 9. At age 17 he watched a drunk friend kick a dog off a cliff and knew he had to escape. He enlisted in the Air Force.

When Henderson got to Yale on the G.I. Bill, he was shocked by the differences between him and his classmates. As he explains in the video above, he learned it was popular for his classmates to hold strong, seemingly progressive views about many of the concerns that shaped his life — drugs, marriage, crime. But they were largely insulated from the consequences of their views. Henderson found that these ideas came to serve as status symbols for the privileged while they, ironically, kept the working class down. He came to call these ideas luxury beliefs.

Henderson went on to get his Ph.D. at Cambridge and wrote a book about his experiences, “Troubled: A Memoir of Family, Foster Care, and Social Class.” In the video, Henderson argues that these out-of-touch views are all around us, widening our class divide and fueling our fractious politics. And he envisions another way.

ghr2M8mh8MA,The New York Times,Jonathan Pie: 'It's 50 Shades of Beige.' Meet Britain's New Prime Minister. | NYT Opinion,"The final votes in Britain's parliamentary elections are still being counted, but one thing is crystal clear: After 14 years in power, the Conservative Party is out.

More than that: It’s been thoroughly punished by the British public, reduced to barely 120 seats, the party’s worst result in it’s history. Several prominent figures — including former Prime Minister Liz Truss — lost their seats.

While other European countries are experiencing a rise in right-wing populism, Britain has rallied behind the centrist and sensible Labour Party and its centrist and sensible leader, Keir Starmer, who becomes prime minister.

To understand this huge trend-bucking shift, we once again turn to the fictional newscaster Jonathan Pie, performed by the comedian Tom Walker. In the Opinion video above, he offers his balanced, professional — and definitely not celebratory — take on the closing of this chapter in British political history.

PiiZNr4E2oU,The New York Times,How ‘Inside Out 2’ Battles Anxiety | Anatomy of a Scene,"It's a battle inside the mind to prevent one young girl’s thoughts from being overrun by anxiety in this scene from “Inside Out 2.”

The sequel once again sets the bulk of its action inside the mind of Riley, who this time around is contending with the onset of puberty. Her emotions are still anthropomorphized by a colorful collection of characters, but with a new stage of adolescence comes an additional cast of emotions. Anxiety (voiced by Maya Hawke) arrives in the form of a wild-looking orange creature with a busy plume and a tendency to overreact.

In this scene, Anxiety is directing a room full of mind workers to draw up projections of everything that could go wrong in Riley’s big hockey match the next day, keeping the girl tossing in her sleep at each negative thought.

Narrating the scene, the film’s director, Kelsey Mann, says, “I always envisioned this being a movie about anxiety taking over, and was reflecting on my own life and how my anxiety does that in me.”

As things become overwhelming, Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) infiltrates Anxiety’s plan and begins to draw up positive projections to send to Riley to make her feel better. As she tries to get the mind workers to rise up against Anxiety, a number of film references come into play, from “Norma Rae” to “Jerry Maguire,” with a little bit of “Network” thrown in.

A lot has happened in the four years since they last appeared together on a debate stage, including a violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, many more months of a raging pandemic, the overturning of Roe v.

In the Opinion Video above, we draw on footage of their past performances, in debates as well as on the campaign trail, to show what each candidate needs to do — and what he needs to avoid — to win the day. The stakes are high, and so is the risk of failure.

CvTEibUlDL4,The New York Times,Nuclear Testing Victims Speak Out: 'I Have Poison in My Blood' | NYT Opinion,"“The possibility of resuming underground nuclear testing has long loomed over the post-Cold War world. But only now do those fears seem worryingly close to being realized amid the growing animosity among the world powers, the construction at testing grounds and the development of a new generation of nuclear weapons,” writes W.J. Hennigan. A return to an earlier era of nuclear testing will bring its own consequences: “The United States and the Soviet Union might have narrowly avoided mutual destruction, but there was a nuclear war.” In the wake of testing, marginalized communities were at the mercy of the bombs’ destruction, causing displacement on their homelands.

8S_G-mk_kOU,The New York Times,Watch Glen Powell and Adria Arjona Fight and Flirt in ‘Hit Man’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"Actions speak louder, and more flirtatiously, than words in this key sequence from “Hit Man,” the rom-com thriller from Richard Linklater now streaming on Netflix.

During the movie’s screenings at film festivals last year, this particular scene had audiences erupting with applause for the feat that it pulls off. It’s “kind of a performance within a performance within a performance,” Linklater says in his narration.

At this point in the movie, the lead character, Gary Johnson (Glen Powell), is at a turning point. He has been working undercover with the New Orleans Police Department as a hit man named Ron. In that role, he developed a secret romantic relationship with a woman who initially tried to solicit Ron for his services. Her name is Madison (Adria Arjona) and she was going to hire Ron to kill her abrasive husband, but Ron talks her out of it.

Madison’s husband later ends up dead, and the police think that Madison is the killer. One of the officers, Jasper (Austin Amelio) has seen Gary and Madison together in public and has suspicions about what’s going on with the two. He decides to put a wire on Gary and send him to talk with Madison in the hopes of creating an entrapment scenario. But to save Madison (and himself), Gary thinks fast and comes up with a way to warn Madison that they are under surveillance.

He types out information to her through his Notes app on his phone and directs her through what to say, and not say, in their conversation, in an exchange that is both sexy and flirty, while also being a tense high-wire act.

“It’s fun to see your hero, the guy you’re invested in, kind of figure his way out of a really sticky, tight situation that I don’t think any of us would be quick enough to find a way out of,” Linklater says.

“It’s a dance, and it’s just fun to see them figure it out as they go.”

In a lively 3 minutes 33 seconds, 10 people describe their feelings about their own periods, from love and pride to discomfort and hate. The wide-ranging chorus is testament to how every woman has a different way of experiencing and relating to her own menstrual cycle.

“It’s just not talked about enough,” one participant declares, an admonishment that stands as the film’s call to action.

d0U-3VsY3CM,The New York Times,Watch an Ambush at the Bullet Farm in ‘Furiosa’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"A great action sequence may involve pyrotechnics, breakneck vehicle maneuvers and other dazzling stunts, but according to the director George Miller, it may prove hollow without a connection to, and between, the characters.

He put a relationship front and center in this sequence from his latest tale in the Mad Max saga, the prequel “Furiosa.” Anya Taylor-Joy stars as the title character and Tom Burke is a driver named Praetorian Jack, with whom Furiosa builds a bond.

In the scene, the pair approach the Bullet Farm to pick up munitions for a battle being waged between Immortan Joe and Dementus. But soon after they arrive and their War Rig passes through a portcullis, they are ambushed and they realize that Dementus has taken over the Bullet Farm.

Taylor-Joy performs her own car stunt requiring her to spin the vehicle 180 degrees. And the sequence plays out in tense ways as both she and Praetorian Jack defend themselves. But narrating the scene, Miller defines the central purpose: “What follows is that through their actions, not their words and their promises to each other but through their actions, that they are prepared to give of themselves entirely to the other.”

He continues, “In a way, it’s kind of a love story in the middle of an action scene.”

KeZ02s-ytos,The New York Times,Two Weeks Inside Gaza’s Ruined Hospitals  | NYT Opinion,"In the Opinion video above, Dr. Samer Attar, an American surgeon from Chicago, shows us the unfathomable brutality of the war in Gaza. He was a member of the first delegation of international doctors to embed in the northern part of the territory this spring.

Over two weeks, Dr. Attar volunteered at local hospitals and filmed what he saw. Al-Awda Hospital — one of the locations where he worked — has been under siege since Sunday and recently ran out of drinking water, with staff members and patients trapped inside.

Dr. Attar’s video diaries capture the war’s toll on civilians and the struggle among Palestinian medical workers to save lives amid extreme shortages of critical medicine, blood and basic supplies in Gaza’s shattered health care sector. As pressure for a cease-fire mounts, Dr. Attar argues in this video that any agreement must include three concrete terms to save thousands of innocent lives in Gaza.

Viewer discretion is advised: The video includes graphic images of severe injuries and suffering.

q5MCw8446gs,The New York Times,‘High-Functioning Anxiety Isn’t a Medical Diagnosis. It’s a Hashtag.’ | NYT Opinion,"Soaring rates of anxiety and depression among adolescents. Medical groups declaring a “national emergency.” The surgeon general calling for an “all of society” response to a “devastating” mental health crisis among young people.

By all indications, kids these days are in rough shape, giving additional urgency to Mental Health Awareness Month, which began on May 1. But in the Opinion video above, Lucy Foulkes, an academic psychologist at Oxford University, argues that the problem may not be a lack of awareness but rather too much.

Amid an enormous societal push to destigmatize mental illness and encourage more conversation about emotions, young people have been flooded with mental health information on social media and elsewhere. But much of it is unreliable and counterproductive.

“I’m deeply concerned that this awareness craze,” Foulkes says, “is ironically making their mental health worse.”

0MyE84UmXTE,The New York Times,How a Village Comes to Life in ‘Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"In this sequence from “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” we see how a tribe functions in an idyllic village before threats emerge. The scene follows Noa (Owen Teague), Soona (Lydia Peckham) and Anaya (Travis Jeffery) as they return from the ritual of collecting an eagle egg that they will nurture.

Narrating the sequence, the director Wes Ball said, “The goal was really just to set up a world that was wonderful, that was ultimately going to be forever changed.”

The scene was shot on location in Australia with the principal actors in performance capture gear. Ball said that they shot the sequence twice, once with the actors, and then a second time without the performers. He said he chose the best performance to be digitally dropped into the scene. He also had other performers do their movements on a stage and put them in as background in the scene as well.

“It’s an interesting process where I can take all of these different little elements and layer them all together,” he said.

VqdWscD-STk,The New York Times,Ketamine Therapy Offers Hope for a Firefighter Struggling with PTSD | An Act of Service | Op-Docs,"Emergency workers and researchers use the term “critical incident” to describe a traumatic event. It’s estimated that people, on average, will experience two to three critical incidents in their lifetimes. My first came at 8 years old, when my father made his first suicide attempt. Five years and five attempts later, he was dead. I’ve been compelled to explore mental health issues — and their potential solutions — ever since.

Research has found that throughout a career, an emergency worker may experience over 180 critical incidents. While observing emergency workers in this documentary, I was amazed by their ability to work so calmly through crises and transition quickly in and out of their home lives. But I came to understand that there was a toll paid for this form of public service, as emergency workers experience rates of behavioral health issues that are notably higher than the general population’s. We depend on emergency workers to provide service during our most vulnerable moments, but these experiences place them critically at risk for issues like PTSD, substance abuse and suicide.

After more than a decade spent working as a peer-support facilitator in suicide prevention and postvention, which involves assisting survivors in the grief process, I slowly became aware of the growing body of evidence supporting psychedelic-assisted therapies as a medical intervention for the types of behavioral health issues I encountered. Like many, I was skeptical. But I eventually learned that major institutions like the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (for which I volunteer) and the Department of Veterans Affairs have supported research into psychedelics such as ketamine. The V.A. even announced this year that it will fund new studies on MDMA and psilocybin-assisted psychotherapies.

I wrote previously that the American West has some of the nation’s worst outcomes for behavioral health issues such as substance abuse and suicide. Growing up in Wyoming, I also saw how the West is home to some of the country’s most conservative cultural and political views on psychedelics. In making this film, I wanted to address that gap and challenge the assumptions of what a typical psychedelic user can and should look like.

This philosophy led me to Rob C., whose last name I’ve withheld to protect his privacy, a firefighter in Idaho who is undergoing ketamine-assisted psychotherapy to treat his PTSD. This use is not approved or regulated by the Food and Drug Administration but is legal in a clinical setting. I hope that his story can become part of a new paradigm for approaching mental health care and shift the public conversation toward the experiences of individuals facing mental health challenges who stand to benefit from these therapies.

OjDCaV1xysU,The New York Times,Watch Ryan Gosling Perform His Own Stunt in ‘The Fall Guy’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"Spicy margaritas, bad decisions and one big stunt make up this sequence from “The Fall Guy.”

Ryan Gosling stars as a stuntman named Colt Seavers alongside Emily Blunt as a cinematographer, Jody Moreno. In this flashback, the two have a flirty conversation over the radio about having a drink after work as Colt prepares for a stunt on set.

For the scene, which involves Gosling’s character falling several stories inside a building, the “Fall Guy” director David Leitch said they opted to create the moment practically and have Gosling perform the stunt himself. This meant hooking the actor to a rig called a descender, used to drop a stunt performer off a building, and then a mechanism provides deceleration for the final 10 feet.

These humanitarian organizations have a direct line to the I.D.F. and come from Western countries, including Israel’s strongest allies. Some of the locations struck had been clearly marked or located in a special humanitarian zone that Israel said was safe for civilians. 

The pattern indicates that in Israel’s battle against Hamas, not even the places with every available avenue of protection are safe from I.D.F. strikes.

In this sequence, which takes place at Stanford, the character Art (Mike Faist), who is attending the university, reconnects with his dear friend Patrick (Josh O’Connor), who has left education to become a tennis pro. Not present in the scene, yet hanging over it, is Tashi (Zendaya), the woman at the center of their complicated triangle.

At this moment, Tashi is dating Patrick, but in this scene, Art is trying to throw a wrench into the relationship. The sequence takes place at the university canteen where the two are chatting over churros. Narrating the sequence, the director Luca Guadagnino said that what is playing out is “a game of rivalry sparkling between these two young boys over Tashi, but at the same time, a jealousy that ignites the relationship also because, probably, these two guys are also jealous of one another.”

That tension is played out in the way that Guadagnino shoots the sequence, holding on a long two-shot as the friends discuss Tashi, then cutting when Patrick realizes the game of manipulation that Art is playing.

“The main guideline in thinking of this movie and the mise en scène was the classic old Hollywood screwball comedy kind of grammar,” Guadagnino said. “Those great movies were all using, in a beautiful way, the stillness of framing to let the performance breathe in all its ambiguities, in all its unspoken conflicts.”

SE_S-dY5ZHM,The New York Times,Criminalizing Homelessness Won't Make It Go Away | NYT Opinion,"If you live in one of America’s cities, you probably see homeless people all the time. You might pass them on your way to work. Maybe you avoid eye contact. If they ask you for money, maybe you pretend you didn’t hear, and walk on by.

But what if you stopped and listened to what they have to say?

As you’ll see in the Opinion video above, you might find their stories of landing on the streets strikingly relatable. Such accounts reveal a hard truth about our country: Amid an affordable housing crisis, where 70 percent of all extremely low-income families today pay more than half their income on rent, becoming homeless is easier than we’d like to think.

That’s what Mark Horvath discovered firsthand in 1995, when he lost his job and wound up homeless for eight years. He started interviewing people on the street in 2008, and began sharing those stories on his YouTube channel, Invisible People. He wanted to try to help viewers who might ignore their homeless neighbors see them not with scorn, or indifference, but empathy.

These stories are even more important today, as a record number of people experience homelessness and face increasing threats from the law. On April 22, the Supreme Court is set to hear the case of Johnson v. Grants Pass, the most significant case in decades about homeless people’s rights. The case will determine whether cities can arrest or fine the homeless — even if there’s no other shelter. As the homeless plaintiffs wrote, this would be “punishing the city’s involuntarily homeless residents for their existence.”

Every homeless person’s path is complicated, and in this video, we haven’t remotely captured anyone’s whole story. Yes, some are addicts, some are mentally ill, some have made unwise choices, and some are simply unlucky. Some are many of those things. But all of them argue that in the hardest moment of their lives, they have been largely abandoned, and even punished, by the rest of us. So we hope you’ll do more than dismiss, or judge, the people in this video, and instead listen to them.

XUhwTVvnq14,The New York Times,Watch a Sniper Scene From ‘Civil War’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"In this sequence from the writer and director Alex Garland’s latest film, “Civil War,” about a modern-day conflict that has broken out in America, journalists making their way to Washington, D.C., stumble across a field set up with Christmas decorations. But the situation couldn’t be less festive. A sniper is set up in a house on a hill above the field. And men in uniform are trying to take the sniper down.

Discussing the scene and its surrealist imagery in his narration, Garland said that in scouting locations, he and his crew came across decorations that were intact more or less as you see them in the film. He said they initially belonged to “a guy who’d put on a winter wonderland festival. People had not dug his winter wonderland festival and he’d gone bankrupt. And he decided just to leave everything just strewn around on a farmer’s field.”

Garland’s aim for the sequence, he said, was to show that “when things get extreme, the reasons why things got extreme no longer become relevant. And the knife edge of the problem is all that really remains relevant.”

bVGijXoBOJA,The New York Times,Watch an Elaborate One-Shot Montage in ‘Música’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"What’s the best way to narratively portray a life that has become nearly impossible to manage? How about with a one-take montage sequence that seems nearly impossible to pull off?

That’s what Rudy Mancuso goes for in his debut feature, “Música” (streaming on Amazon Prime Video), which he directed, composed, co-wrote (with Dan Lagana) and stars in.

The character he plays, Rudy, has been dividing his attention between the three closest women in his life: his girlfriend, Haley (Francesca Reale), with whom he’s hit difficult times; his mother, Maria (Maria Mancuso), and a new woman he is getting to know, Isabella (Camila Mendes). He’s lying to all three. “On the page, it was actually called the ‘Rhythm of Lies,’” Mancuso said in his narration.

The scene is shot on a warehouse stage, with sets flying in and out to represent the different encounters Rudy has with these women. He moves from setup to setup, changing his clothes along the way, with lighting cues syncopated to the music. (Watch for that moment where Rudy starts a kiss with one woman, freezes in place and finishes the kiss with another woman.)

Mancuso said that he and his crew needed half a day of rehearsal and a half a day of shooting 14 takes to pull it all off along.

“This would not have been possible without the hard work of my production designer, Patrick Sullivan, and my amazing DP, Shane Hurlbut,” he said.

D9P196Fm0lM,The New York Times,The Deep State Is Kind of Awesome | NYT Opinion,"As America closes in on a major election, mistrust is brewing around the mysterious government entity that’s now denounced in scary-sounding terms — “the deep state” and “the swamp.” What do those words even mean? Who exactly do they describe?

We went on a road trip to find out. As we met the Americans who are being dismissed as public enemies, we discovered that they are … us. They like Taylor Swift. They dance bachata. They go to bed at night watching “Star Trek” reruns. They go to work and do their jobs: saving us from Armageddon.

Sure, our tax dollars pay them, but as you’ll see in the video above, what a return on our investment we get!

When we hear “deep state,” instead of recoiling, we should rally. We should think about the workers otherwise known as our public servants, the everyday superheroes who wake up ready to dedicate their careers and their lives to serving us. These are the Americans we employ. Even though their work is often invisible, it makes our lives better.

But if Donald Trump is re-elected and enacts Schedule F, that could change. He would have the power to eviscerate the so-called deep state and replace our public servants with people who work for him, not us.

In the video above, you’ll meet a few of our hard-working American public servants, and we hope you’ll agree that they’re not scary at all. In fact, they’re kind of awesome.

9s3CN5EafNs,The New York Times,Denying Your Health Care Is Big Business in America | NYT Opinion,"Should your insurance company be allowed to stop you from getting a treatment — even if your doctor says it’s necessary?

Doctors are often required to get insurance permission before providing medical care. This process is called prior authorization and it can be used by profit-seeking insurance companies to create intentional barriers between patients and the health care they need.

At best, it’s just a minor bureaucratic headache. At worst, people have died.

Prior authorization has been around for decades, but doctors say its use has increased in recent years and now rank it as one of the top issues in health care.

To produce the Opinion Video above, we spoke to more than 50 doctors and patients. They shared horror stories about a seemingly trivial process that inflicts enormous pain, on a daily basis. The video also explains how a process that is supposed to save money actually inflates U.S. health care costs while enriching insurance companies.

Prior authorization has come under intense scrutiny in Congress in the past few years, but bipartisan proposals have repeatedly stalled. Under public pressure, some insurance companies — like United Healthcare and Cigna — have said they would reduce the use of prior authorization. And in January, the Biden administration finalized a plan to put limited guardrails around this practice. But doctors say that these efforts only scratch the surface and should go further.

This issue is ultimately about the role of insurance companies in American health care: Should they have more power than your doctor to decide what’s medically best for you?

NAtJ2lLNenE,The New York Times,How an Argument Resonates in ‘Anatomy of a Fall’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"A couple has an argument that escalates in this scene from “Anatomy of a Fall,” the drama from Justine Triet that won the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 2023, then went on to receive five Oscar nominations this year, including best picture.

In the film, the couple’s fight begins as audio that is presented in court where Sandra (Sandra Hüller) is on trial for the death of her husband, Samuel (Samuel Theis).

Then, Triet makes the choice to show visuals of the fight, rather than only providing us the sound. We move from the courtroom into this domestic scene in the kitchen. Narrating the sequence, she explained that “sound has the power to give the perfect illusion of the present,” so she wanted to add visuals to give a more complete picture of the fractures between these two people.

Triet decided to shoot the scene with two cameras, “not to lose any of their energy,” she said. And she wanted to the scene to take place during daylight, with the sun shining through a window.

“Often, very dramatic, intimate scenes are used to being filmed at night, as if intimacy were separate from the rest of life,” she said. “And here, I choose the opposite. And the contrast between light and violence is even stronger for me.”

m32Mp-OuGVg,The New York Times,They’re Programmed to Work — What Happens If They Stop? | Hardly Working - Total Refusal | Op-Docs,"In this short documentary, a laundress, a stablehand, a street sweeper and a carpenter are observed with ethnographic precision. They are nonplayer characters, or NPCs, in the blockbuster Wild West-themed video game Red Dead Redemption 2, and many of them are trapped in work.

NPCs populate the gaming world as background extras. They simulate being alive, but their rhythm of life is controlled by looped activities — which they exercise tirelessly and repetitively into infinity.

These NPCs are Sisyphean machines, programmed to get stuck in the routines of everyday life without results. Occasionally, the NPCs glitch, breaking their cycles and revealing their own flawedness. In these moments, they seem touchingly human.

We’re an artist collective whose work explores contemporary computer and video games. Here, we reflect on the question of work and what’s supposed to be normal. Despite the game’s turn-of-the-century setting, the labor routines, activity patterns — as well as bugs and malfunctions — paint a vivid analogy for how workers today toil under capitalism.

Can we, the nonplayer characters of a political economy that controls, exploits and alienates us, find a way to rebel against the absurdity of our own activities?

- Film and Text by Total Refusal (https://totalrefusal.com/, @totalrefusal) The collective explores the field of contemporary video and computer games through artistic interventions.

That home is positioned directly next door to the camp. In the kitchen, Rudolf’s wife, Hedwig, sits and gossips with friends. In another room, Rudolf meets with the engineers of a crematory. But the scene primarily follows Aniela, a young Polish girl who works in the home, preparing a glass of schnapps to celebrate the commandant’s birthday, and delivering boots to him during his meeting.

Discussing the scene, the film’s director, Jonathan Glazer, said that he chose to follow Aniela, rather than the main characters, “because it’s really one of the only times in the film where we can see and connect and spend time with, essentially, a victim of these atrocities.”

He explained that he chose to use multiple cameras to shoot the scene, and the film overall, because “I really didn’t want to have sort of the artificial construction of a conventional film to tell this story. Rather, to view them anthropologically, as if we were a fly on the wall.”

I spent most of my childhood in Sydney’s Chinatown, by my mother’s side during school holidays as she worked the checkout at a Chinese supermarket.

As a child I was mystified by the magnificent lions that would appear, as if from nowhere, on the streets of Chinatown and the Sydney suburbs. I would watch with awe as they performed elaborate dances during cultural events.

My work as a filmmaker is dedicated to Australian immigrant communities like the one I grew up in. When I was commissioned by the Powerhouse Museum to direct this short documentary, I discovered that almost every Asian person I spoke to has a friend or a family member in the lion dancing community.

The commitment of lion dancers to their craft is astounding, and I want to draw attention to the people inside the performance, people who dedicate a significant part of their lives to this tradition.

Gh0R_eg225c,The New York Times,How Scorsese Moves the Camera With Purpose in ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"To tell the sweeping story of the Osage murders of the 1920s in “Killers of the Flower Moon” (nominated for 10 Oscars, including best picture), the director Martin Scorsese opted mostly not to sweep the camera along with the narrative.

“Dealing with the landscape and the period, I tended to have more stable images,” he said during a video interview, “images that were almost like old photographs in a way.”

But one key moment called for a change. As investigators go to Oklahoma to look into the Osage murders and disappearances, they drill down to a group of individuals they think are involved. And in this scene, the lawmen converge to arrest one person they believe they can get information from, Ernest Burkhart, played by Leonardo DiCaprio.

As Ernest sits in a pool hall/barbershop, investigators descend on the space to surround him.

“Since the characters are all circling around each other in the movie, and since the circle gets tighter and tighter, my drawing for the shot was simply a circle with an arrow. That was it,” Scorsese said.

What follows is what the director called “a circular ballet,” with the camera continually moving around Ernest as he turns repeatedly, along with investigators moving in on him from different directions.

“That was one of the most enjoyable moments, laying out that shot,” he said.

The film then cuts to an interrogation room, with Ernest on one side of the frame, investigators on the other. This returns the movie back to more stable images, but with depth. The wide shot looks almost as if it’s playing out on a stage, the players shown full body and arranged in a kind of uneasy tableau.

“Once scenes and stories like this end up in police stations or interrogation rooms, I find the images become flat and uninteresting,” Scorsese said. “And so I said, let’s be dealing with angles that are boring into the characters. Not boring images, but boring, like really focused on them.”

Scorsese made the shots more head on, but also employs a passing-of-time technique that he said was inspired by the 1947 Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger drama “Black Narcissus.” At one moment during the interrogation, the scene cuts to Ernest in a medium shot and fades to black. Then it fades right back in on him standing in the same place.

”We may have faded away for an hour to two hours,” Scorsese said. “You don’t expect to come fading back in on the same image,” he said.

In telling this story, the filmmaker concluded, “what I had to do was fight a tendency to over-design camera interpretation. In so doing, a tension is held in the frame.”

ZhV4Z76mXrI,The New York Times,"There’s a Tax Season Villain, and It’s Not the I.R.S. | NYT Opinion","It’s the most miserable time of the year: tax season.

Americans are about to spend millions of hours and billions of dollars filing their federal income taxes, and they are pretty sure they know who is responsible for their pain: The misanthropes at the Internal Revenue Service.

But we’re here to convince you that the I.R.S. is not the problem.

Yes, it should be easy to file taxes. And yes, it should be free. That’s how it works in the rest of the developed world, and it could very easily work that way here, too. It is absurd that America’s tax system is so antiquated and complicated that most people must pay someone else to help them pay the government.

So what is standing in the way of progress?

Watch.

nvlGKzHgx1M,The New York Times,"Our Friend is Gone, but Our Resistance in Myanmar Lives On | Op-Docs","San Zaw Htway was an artist, activist, political prisoner and dear friend.

From 2013 to 2017, we lived and worked in Myanmar with San Zaw Htway, who spent 13 years — of a 36-year-sentence — imprisoned under harsh conditions. He died at the end of 2017 after a cancer diagnosis.

San Zaw Htway touched many lives, serving as a dedicated trauma counselor to former political prisoners and teaching children and refugees to make artwork using recycled materials, as he did when he was in prison. After the February 2021 military coup in Myanmar, a Burmese friend wrote to us asking, “What would San Zaw Htway have done in a time like this?”

And so the idea for this short documentary was born.

We asked San Zaw Htway’s loved ones, some of whom are in hiding or are involved in the resistance, to write to him as an act of remembrance and a way of seeking solace and hope in the midst of the military’s brutal crackdown. This film is composed of their words, read by narrators to protect the identity of the writers.

Until the end of his life, San Zaw Htway retained his gentle wisdom and joy; his many years of suffering did not harden him to the world. As the people of Myanmar continue to live under violent military rule, we hope this film will shine a light on his legacy and the Burmese activists who have followed in his footsteps.

W9mPEquFKKA,The New York Times,We Need to Get Back to 1980 on Immigration | NYT Opinion,"Why have Republicans and Democrats moved so far apart on immigration? That’s the question that drives the Opinion video above.

We are publishing this as President Biden comes under extraordinary pressure to curb surging illegal immigration at the southwestern border. Republicans have held up further military aid to Ukraine, demanding more border security in exchange. And this month House Republicans opened impeachment hearings against Alejandro Mayorkas, the homeland security secretary, accusing him of intentionally failing to enforce immigration laws.

A group of senators from both parties has been trying to negotiate a deal that would address the Republican demands for a border crackdown. But while the measures under discussion might go some way toward lowering illegal immigration — and even that is a matter of fierce debate — they don’t pretend to address all the wide-ranging, chronic problems with the country’s immigration system.

Bipartisan deals on immigration policy have been elusive for decades. The last big immigration reform bill passed in 1986, during the Reagan administration, and a smaller bill was signed into law four years later by George H.W. Bush.

Since then, Democrats and Republicans, on the subject of immigration, have seemed to sprint in opposite directions.

So what happened?

Hint: It’s not all Donald Trump’s fault.

o_GPSEVEasE,The New York Times,Watch the Opening Scene of ‘Oppenheimer’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"Raindrops help usher in the opening moments of “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s ambitious, Oscar-nominated biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the “father of the atomic bomb.” Those simple raindrops give way to high resolution images of bomb detonation that are both sobering and fascinating.

Narrating the sequence, Nolan said that the idea to open with the raindrops came late to him and his editor, Jennifer Lame, “but ultimately became a motif that runs the whole way through the film and became very important.”

The scene introduces us to the two timelines the feature is broken into: fission and fusion, two approaches to releasing nuclear energy. The fission sequences are in color, while fusion segments are shot in black and white on special IMAX film developed expressly for the movie.

The scene, which features Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, encapsulates the themes of hubris and regret that will be explored more deeply over the course of the film.

v2VUt3l7Hy4,The New York Times,Watch Adam Driver Keep Time in a Scene From ‘Ferrari’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"The spiritual meets the primal in this scene from the biopic “Ferrari.”

As the sequence begins, the automotive mogul Enzo Ferrari (Adam Driver) arrives at a workers mass. The priest gives a speech about the miracle of the internal combustion engine. But attendees are distracted by another event happening simultaneously at the Autodromo, a nearby racetrack. Maserati is challenging Ferrari for the record there. So scenes of worship are intercut with the driver, Jean Behra (Derek Hill, the son of Phil Hill, the first American-born Formula 1 champion), navigating the course. In the church, Ferrari and his workers have their stopwatches out to time the Maserati.

Narrating the scene, the director Michael Mann said, “My serious intent was to imbue into audiences minds what’s in our characters’ minds, which is there’s something almost religious and deadly serious about it. The metaphysical, the savage power is really what is wedded together as a value in this scene.”

6H0tvsz3-pg,The New York Times,A New Way to Fight Bad Bosses | NYT Opinion,"As the Opinion video above explores, these are heady times for organized labor.

Unions have recently scored big victories in the auto industry and Hollywood; an increasing number of health care workers are starting to organize; and the threat of a strike resulted in big gains for hospitality workers in Las Vegas. Elsewhere, baristas, nail salon and fast food workers, graduate students, warehouse and retail workers, tech employees, domestic workers and ride-share drivers have been mobilizing as unions enjoy levels of public support not seen since the 1960s.

But it’s not all good news: The percentage of workers who belong to a union plunged to its lowest level on record in 2022.

In this video, Jeff Seal, a video journalist and comedian, argues for the wider use of an industry mechanism known as a minimum standards council to strengthen the labor movement and empower workers.

We’re not going to use this space to explain what minimum standards councils are. We’ll leave that to Jeff, who, in describing how these boards work and why we should care, takes viewers on a cross-country adventure and deploys an Uncle Sam wearing earrings, a megaphone on the streets of Seattle, a drive-through fast food order, boxing and even his mother.

hkEZ2OiFVl4,The New York Times,I Went Abroad Hoping to Help. I Came Back Disillusioned. | Red Ears | Op-Docs,"Until 2011, conscription was mandatory for German men, with the option to refuse armed service and do civil service at home or abroad instead. In 2009 at age 19, I chose to go abroad as part of a development aid program, hoping that I would have the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to a community. I went to Senegal for a one-year civil service assignment for a German nongovernmental organization that I picked from a list of options provided by a ministry’s website.

During my time with the organization, I grew increasingly disillusioned. I didn’t see a development project operating in the way it was described to the public. The sewing school was neglected, the cultural center where I lived was empty, and some donations from Germany disappeared or rotted away in containers. As part of my work, I was eventually asked to volunteer in a hospital in Thiès, which involved many duties that I was not properly trained or prepared for.

Almost 13 years later, I decided to make a film based on my memories, videos and photographs from Senegal, as well as a present-day interview with Madeleine, a friend I made during my time there. The result is this short documentary, which aims to examine the paradigm of foreign aid and volunteerism through the lens of my experiences.

sbcnPPRup6Y,The New York Times,Watch Taraji P. Henson Sing in ‘The Color Purple’ | Anatomy of a Scene,"Shug Avery knows how to make an entrance.

The sultry nightclub singer lights up a room, and a swamp, in this scene from “The Color Purple,” the film musical adaptation of Alice Walker’s novel. At the beginning of the sequence, a performance of the song “Push Da Button,” Shug (Taraji P. Henson), wearing a shimmering red dress and a feathered headdress, arrives at a juke joint on a barge.

The director Blitz Bazawule, narrating the sequence, said that his production designer, Paul D. Austerberry, suggested shooting it on location, rather than on a soundstage. They found a swamp in Georgia that they drained and refilled, to build the juke joint in which Shug performs.

Bazawule said that it took two weeks of rehearsal to figure out the blocking, with choreography by Fatima Robinson. It was “very important that we gave Taraji an opportunity to shine,” he explained. Henson does all of her own singing in the scene, having taken vocal lessons to prepare for the role.

An idea for a dance break while the lights are shut off came to Bazawule when he was on set early one day, before shooting, and saw the environmental lights on. “The blue light started to bleed through,” he recalled. “I said to myself, ‘I think that’s it. If we can go from light to darkness this way, I think we could have something special.’”
